    Example Requirements for a Supermarket Simulation

    1. User Requirement

        1.1 As a user, I want multiple customers to visit locations in the supermarket.

        1.2 After running the simulation the output should be a CSV table similar to the initial customer data.

        1.3 I want to run the program many times to see how dense the different sections of the supermarket are over time, how many people go to the checkout etc.

    2. System Requirements

        2.1 The customers should considered churned once they reach the checkout.

        2.2 A customer should be implemented in it’s own class

        2.3 The customers move to the next location based on a Monte Carlo Chain.

        2.4 The class Supermarket should manage multiple Customer objects that are currently in the market

    3. Nonfunctional Requirements

        3.1 implementation is to be done in Python

        3.2 the program should run on a machine with at least 2 GB

        3.3 the program should run on all OS

        3.4 the code needs to be cleaned with pylint
